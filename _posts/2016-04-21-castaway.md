> While filming television series River Monsters last November, a production crew for U.S. network Animal Planet discovered something they never expected: a castaway on a deserted island.
> The team, including presenter Robert Wade, were investigating the death of six men in a plane crash near Australia's Gulf of Carpentaria when they came across the fisherman who had been separated from his boat for 60 hours.

WOAH. That is insane. Who knew the movies would come true.
