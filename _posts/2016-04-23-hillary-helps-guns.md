> All foreign weapons sales required approval from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The sales include over $100 million dollars ($100,737,273.66 by my count) of gun sales in 2011 alone. A sizeable fraction of these were handheld guns manufactured by household name gun makers: Colt, Beretta and Remington. These approvals represented lucrative deals for gun manufacturers that fund the National Rifle Association. Lee Fang found bankruptcy documents that prove Colt Defense was funding the NRA. Business Insider reports that “the bulk of the group’s money now comes in the form of contributions, grants, royalty income, and advertising, much of it originating from gun industry sources.” NRA donors also include Beretta USA, for which Clinton approved $6.4 million in sales that year.

> General Dynamics was approved by Clinton to sell $103 million dollars of ammunition in 2011. General Dynamics is represented in Washington D.C. by The Podesta Group, a lobbying firm co-founded by Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign chair John Podesta, and currently run by his brother.

Hillary maybe you should apologize for guns in New York.
